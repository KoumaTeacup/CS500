<h2>Tonemapping operators reference</h2>

<p>Luminance HDR is based on pfstmo backend that implements algorithms from published 
scientific papers on HDR imaging. Most HDR tools are based on these papers, but 
Luminance is kind of different in a way that it actually uses terminology from the 
papers. Which means that if you are not a PhD in color science, you need a good 
explanation, otherwise you are lost.</p>

<p>This section helps understanding underlying algorithms and explains how to 
better use a particular tonemapping operator.</p>
